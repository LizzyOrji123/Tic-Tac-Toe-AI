# **Tic-Tac-Toe AI**  
A **Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe** game where a user competes against an **AI opponent** with basic decision-making abilities.  

## **🚀 Project Overview**
This Tic-Tac-Toe project is structured using a **modular approach** for cleaner and more maintainable code.  
Instead of a single script, the project is broken down into multiple files, each handling a specific function.  

### **🔹 Features**
✅ Play **against AI** (AI picks optimal moves using heuristics).  
✅ **Detects winner or tie** based on board state.  
✅ **Separation of concerns** (game logic, board display, AI moves, rules, etc.).  
✅ **Easily extendable** for better AI or graphical improvements.

│── board.py       # Handles board setup & printing
│── player.py      # User move logic
│── ai.py          # AI move logic
│── rules.py       # Check winner & tie
│── utils.py       # Helper functions
│── README.md      # Documentation file

## **🛠️ Setup Instructions**
### **🔹 Prerequisites**
Ensure you have:
- **Python 3.7+** installed  
- **VS Code (or any Python IDE)**  

### **🔹 Running the Game**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```
3. **Run the game**:
   ```
   python game.py
   ```

## **⚠️ Problems Encountered & Fixes**
### **1️⃣ Import Issues (`ModuleNotFoundError`)**
✅ **Issue:** `game.py` calls functions from `utils.py`, but `utils.py` wasn’t importing `check_winner()`.  
✅ **Fix:** Added the following import at the top of `utils.py`:  
   ```python
   from rules import check_winner, is_tie
   ```
✅ **Why?** Python needs explicit imports when files are in different modules.  

### **2️⃣ AI Not Picking Best Moves**
✅ **Issue:** AI was selecting random moves, ignoring chances to win/block.  
✅ **Fix:** Improved AI logic in `ai.py`:
   - **Step 1:** AI first checks **if it can win** in the next move.  
   - **Step 2:** AI then checks **if it needs to block the user**.  
   - **Step 3:** If no immediate winning/blocking move, **AI picks randomly**.  

### **3️⃣ Board Not Displaying Properly**
✅ **Issue:** Improper formatting when printing the board.  
✅ **Fix:** Updated `print_board()` in `board.py` to ensure **correct row separation**:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, 9, 3):
       print(f"{board[i]} | {board[i+1]} | {board[i+2]}")
       if i < 6:
           print("-" * 9)
   ```
✅ **Why?** Prevents overlapping prints and ensures a clean Tic-Tac-Toe board.

## **🚀 Future Improvements**
✅ **Enhance AI Strategy** – Make AI **more intelligent** using **minimax** or **machine learning**.  
✅ **Add Score Tracking** – Keep a record of **wins/losses/draws**.  
✅ **Implement a GUI** – Use `Tkinter` or `PyGame` for **graphical gameplay** instead of terminal input.  
✅ **Multiplayer Mode** – Allow **two players to compete** instead of just AI vs. Human.
